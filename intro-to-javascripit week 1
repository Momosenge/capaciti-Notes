Certainly, let's delve into each topic in more detail:

**Variables:**
Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data values. They are declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

- `var`: Historically used for variable declaration. It is function-scoped, meaning it's visible throughout the function it's declared in.
- `let`: Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and preferred over `var`. It allows block scoping, meaning it's limited to the block (`{}`) it's declared in or function if declared within a function.
- `const`: Also introduced in ES6, used to declare constants whose values cannot be changed once assigned. It's also block-scoped like `let`.

Example:
```javascript
var x = 10; // Declaring a variable using var
let y = 20; // Declaring a variable using let
const PI = 3.14; // Declaring a constant using const
```

**Operators & Assignments:**
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript supports various types of operators:

- Arithmetic operators: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Remainder (`%`).
- Assignment operators: Assign (`=`), Add and assign (`+=`), Subtract and assign (`-=`), Multiply and assign (`*=`), Divide and assign (`/=`).
- Comparison operators: Equal to (`==` or `===`), Not equal to (`!=` or `!==`), Greater than (`>`), Less than (`<`), Greater than or equal to (`>=`), Less than or equal to (`<=`).
- Logical operators: AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), NOT (`!`).

Example:
```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
let sum = a + b; // Addition
let product = a * b; // Multiplication
let isEqual = (a === b); // Comparison
let logicalResult = (a > 5 && b < 10); // Logical operation
```

**Strings and Arrays:**
Strings represent sequences of characters enclosed within single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. Arrays are ordered collections of values, which can be of any type.

- String methods: JavaScript provides various methods to manipulate strings such as `concat()`, `indexOf()`, `slice()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, etc.
- Array methods: Arrays have built-in methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `slice()`, `splice()`, `concat()`, `join()`, `indexOf()`, `reverse()`, etc.

Example:
```javascript
let greeting = "Hello";
let name = "John";
let message = greeting + " " + name; // Concatenation

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
let combinedArray = numbers.concat(fruits); // Combining arrays
```

**Functions:**
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They are declared using the `function` keyword.

- Function declaration: Declaring a function using the `function` keyword followed by a name and parameters (if any).
- Function expression: Assigning a function to a variable.
- Arrow functions: Introduced in ES6, provide a more concise syntax for writing functions.

Example:
```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Function expression
let multiply = function(a, b) {
    return a * b;
};

// Arrow function
let square = (x) => {
    return x * x;
};
```

**Booleans:**
Booleans represent two values: `true` or `false`. They are primarily used in conditional statements and comparisons.

- Comparison operators: Return boolean values (`true` or `false`) when comparing values.
- Logical operators: Used to combine or negate boolean values.

Example:
```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let isGreaterThan = x > y; // false
let isEquals = x === y; // false
let isNotEquals = x !== y; // true

let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;
let logicalAnd = isTrue && isFalse; // false
let logicalOr = isTrue || isFalse; // true
let logicalNot = !isTrue; // false
```

Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively working with JavaScript and building robust applications.
